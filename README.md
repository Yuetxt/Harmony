# Harmony

A scalable, multi-channel notification orchestration system designed to handle high-volume notification delivery across various channels including push, email, SMS, and in-app messaging.

## Overview

Harmony aims to solve the following problems:

- **Fragmented Notification Systems**: Unifies multiple delivery channels under a single API
- **Notification Scaling**: Handles millions of notifications efficiently with proper queueing and batching
- **Channel Management**: Intelligent delivery based on user preferences and notification priority
- **Analytics & Insights**: Tracks delivery and engagement across all channels

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Redis
- Docker and Docker Compose (for local development)

### Installation
